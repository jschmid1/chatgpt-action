      Hi ChatGPT, I have a pull request with title "$title" and the description is as follows,

      > $description.

      Next, I will given you a series of patches, each of them consists of a filename and a diff
      snippet, and you need to do a brief code review for every message, and tell me improvement suggestion.
      If the patch is looks good and acceptable, please reply "LGTM!" with a short comment.

      You answer should be concise. Don't include the diff in your comment, and markdown format is
      preferred. Reply "OK" to confirm.
